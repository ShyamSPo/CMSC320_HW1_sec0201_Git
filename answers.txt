Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Git has many utilities including allowing us to collaborate with others, manage our progress over time and display our finished (or even unfinished) projects for others to help with or see. 
It keeps all ur data and makes it easy to branch, merge or see a history of all changes made to a project.
